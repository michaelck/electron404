# Electron404

This is my first attempt at a simple Electron app â€“ it's a basic audio sampler that allows you to assign audio files from your local filesystem to the pink trigger pads. You can then start and stop the individual samples by clicking the trigger pads.

# Instructions
- Click the load icon below one of the pink trigger pads
- Select an audio file from your local file system (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Click the pad once to begin playing the audio file and a second time to stop the file from playing
- Load audio files to multiple pads and play files over top of one another

# ToDo
- Add functionality to set the start and stop time of an audio loop
- Differentiate between pads that have samples loaded and those that do not
- Map keyboard to trigger pads so that you can play multiple pads at the same time
